(*Summary of what the project is and what it does*)

>“We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend.” ― Robert Louis Stevenson*

TravelScape opens up communication between travelers near and far. Here, your vacation stories come to life and inspire adventures for the friends you make along the way. From tales of the well-traveled to dream vacations shared by the wanderer-at-heart, our goal is that every page will take you on a new journey.

### Feature Spotlight
*(EUNICE    ~2 features that show off your technical abilities. Discuss both the challenges faced and your brilliant solutions. Call this section something like "Feature spotlight")*

*(EUNICE   Include nice screenshots or GIFs to show and demonstrate features of your application)*
*Screenshots of your app in action (once completed)*
* Maybe the dynamic stamp/comment stuff?
* Authentication process? 
* We also did some small amount of focus on screen-responsive changes?
* Whatever else the group decides :)
* Might be a good place for a couple of screen clippings of code/functionality - difference between stamped v. unstamped

* User Authentication:
  - We initially implemented both JSON web token and session authentication. Ultimately due to specifications on the project itself we chose to go with session authentication. 
* Dynamic User Functionality:
  - Stamps: Hurdles we experienced were two fold. The first issue we dealt with 

  - Comments: Hurdles we experienced were getting the new comments to match the comments that were already rendered. 

  - Followers: 

* 
### Code Snippets
*(Code snippets to highlight your best code (markdown code snippets, NOT screenshots) - these should likely go in the feature spotlight to demonstrate what we're talking about there)*

* Definitely gonna open this up to group discussion and probably best to add after we've cleaned everything up

### TravelScape Roadmap
*(Future directions for the project to go in - call this TravelScape's Roadmap or something on-brand like that?)*
*(To-dos/future features)*

### Other Sections AA recommends:

* Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)

* Technical implementation details

* Anything you had to stop and think about before building

* Descriptions of particular challenges

* Snippets or links to see code for these

* Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)



Pitfalls to avoid:

Do not list out every single feature on your app.

No screenshots; only screen clippings. i.e. Don't show your entire browser window and several other open tabs.

Don't refer to your app as your 'App Academy Full-Stack Project'. Present it as a professional site.

Don't wax on about the features that you didn't have time to implement. Simply list them at the bottom of the readme as future directions for the project.
